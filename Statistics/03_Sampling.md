## Sampling

Sampling: The process of drawing a subset of data from a population.  
Target population = Complete set of elements.  

#### Sampling process:

* Identify the Target Population.
* Select the sampling frame.
* Choose the samping method.
* Determine the sample size.
* Collect the sample data.

## Choosing a sampling method:
* Probability Sampling:  
Uses random selection to generate a sample.
* Non Probability Sampling:  
Based on convenience or personal preference.  
Often less expensive and more conveninet.  
Maybe useful for expxloratory studies, where conclusions are not drawn.  

## Types of Probability Sampling
* Simple Random Sampling.
> Every member is selected randomly and has an equal chance of being chosen.  
Fairy Representative.  
Avoids bias  
Expensive and time consuing.  

* Stratified Random Sampling.
> Divide a population into groups and randomly select some members from each group.  
Each group is called a strata.  
More accurate results per strata.  
May be difficult to identify strata.

* Cluster Random Sampling.
> Divide a population into clusters, randomly select certain clusters, include all members from the chosen cluster in the sample.  
Helpful when delaing with large and diverse populations that have clearly defined subgroups.  
Maybe difficult to create clusters that accurately reflect the overall population. 

* Systematic Random Sampling.
> Put every member into an ordered sequence. From a random starting point, choose members at regular intervals.  
Fairly representative.  
Quick and convenient.  
It is required to know the size of the population. Or it will be difficult to choose the intervals.

## Non Probability Sampling


#### Sampling Bias
When the sample is not representative of the population as a whole.  

#### Types of Non Probability Sampling:
* Convenience Sampling.
> Members of a population are eacy to contact or reach.  
Often shows Undercoverage Bias (Members of population are inadequately represented)
* Voluntary Response Sampling. 
> Consists members of a population who volunteer to participate in a study.  
Often affected by Non Response Bias (Certain members of a group are less ikely to provide a response)
* Snowball Sampling.
> Initial participants are recruited and ask them to recruit other people.  
May be affected by Sampling Bias (Members may share similar characteristics)
* Purposive Sampling.
> Participants are selected based on the purpose of study.  
Could lead to biased outcomes (Members are not likely to be representive of the overall population)
