## Confidence Intervals

A range of values that describes the uncertainity surrounding an estimate.  
Point Estimate: Uses a single value to estimate a population parameter. For example, mean height of people in a city is 70 kgs.  
Interval Estimate: Uses a range of values to estimate a population parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval that the mean weight is between 68 and 72 kgs - 95% CI [68, 72]  
Margin of error in the above case is +/- 2

$Margin of Error = Z-score * SE$  
SE = Standard Error  
Z score measures the distance of a data point from the population mean in a standard normal distribution. 

#### Confidence Level
Describes the likelihood that a particuar sampling method will produce a confidence interval that includes the population parameter.  
$95\% CI [68, 72]$ means 95% Confidence level that the Confidence Interval is between 68 and 72, with the Margin of Error being 2.


Most common Confidence Levels and their Z-scores:  
90% --> Z-score = 1.645  
95% --> Z-score = 1.96  
99% --> Z-score = 2.58  

#### Steps to construct Confidence Interval
* Identify a Sample Statistic  
Could be mean or a proportion (% value)
* Choose a Confidence Interval  
95% is the most common
* Find the Margin of error
* Calculate the Interval
