## Hypothesis Testing
A statistical procedure that uses sample data to evaluate an assumption about a population parameter.  

#### Statistical Signifncance
The claim that the results of a test or experiment are not explainable by chance alone.

#### Steps for performing a Hypothesis test
* State the null hyphothesis and the alternative hypothesis.  
* Choose a significance level.
* Find the P-value.
* Reject or Fail to reject the nul hypothesis.

#### Nul Hypothesis
A statement that is assumed to be true unless there is convincing evidence to the contrary.  

#### Alternative Hypothesis
A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, and is accepted as true only if there is convincing evidence for it.

Common Significane levels: 5%, 1%, 10% 

#### P-value
The probability of observing results as or more extreme than those observed when the null hypothesis is true.  
If the Probability is less than P-value, then there is strong evidence for the Alternative hypothesis.  

* If P-value < Significance Level: Reject the Null Hypothesis.  
* If P-value > Significance Level: Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis.  

#### Types of errors in Hypothesis Testing
* Type 1 error (False Positive)  
The rejection of a null hypothesis is actually true.  
* Type 2 error (False Negative)  
Failing to reject a null hypothesis which is actually false.

Choosing a lower Significance Level avoids Type 1 error but may lead to Type 2 error.

#### Possible outcomes:
* Reject the Null Hypothesis when it is actually true (Type 1 Error)
* Reject the Null Hypothesis when it is actually false (Correct)
* Fail to reject the Null Hypothesis when it is actualy true (Correct)
* Fail to reject the Null Hypothesis when it is actualy false (Type 2 Error)

## 1 Sample test
Determines whether or not a population parameter like a mean or a proportion is equal to a specific value.

Examples:  
A company's average sales revenue is equal to a target value.  
A medical treatment's average rate of success is equal to a set goal.  
A stock portfolio's average rate of requrn is equal to a market benchmark.

#### 1 Sample Z-test
Assumptions:  
* The data is a random sample of a normally distributed proportion.
* The population standard deviation is known.

## 2 Sample test
Determines whether or not 2 population parameters like 2 means or 2 proportions are equal to each other.  
Used in A/B testing.

#### 2 Sample T-test for means
Assumptions:  
* The 2 samples are independent of each other.
* For each sample, the data is drawn randomly from a normally distributed population.  
* The population standard deviation is unknown.
