## Discrete Probability

#### Random Variable
Represents the values for the possible outcomes of a random event.  
* Discrete Random Variable  
Has a countable number of possible values.(Countabe outcome)  
Eg: If you toss a coin 5 times, you can count the number of times you get Heads.
* Continuous Random Variable  
Takes all possible values in some range (Measurable outcome)  
For example, the height of a tree can be 5m or 5.2m or 5.21m or 5.215m

Sample space = Set of all possible values for a Random Variable.  
Sample space for a single coin toss = {Heads, Tails}  
Sample space for a single die roll = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  

#### Binomial Distribution

For repeated trials, with each trial having 2 possible outcomes.  
Only 2 possible outcomes.  
Events are mutually exclusive.  
Each event is independent.

#### Poission Distribution

Calculates the probability that a certain number of events will occur during a specific time period.  
Number of events in the experiement can be counted.  
Mean no. of events that occur during a specific time period is known.  
Each event is independent.

## Continuous Probability

#### Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
Symmetrical on both sides of the mean and bell-shaped.  
Mean is located at the centre of the bell curve.  
Total area under the curve is 1.  

Emperical rule for normal distribution:  
68% of values fal within 1 Standard Deviation of the mean.  
95% of values fal within 2 Standard Deviation of the mean.  
99.7% of values fal within 3 Standard Deviation of the mean.
