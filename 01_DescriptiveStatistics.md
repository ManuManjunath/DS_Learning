## Measures of Central tendency

### Mean
Mean (Or Average) = Sum of vaues/Number of values  
Mean of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 = (10+12+14+16+18)/5 = 70/5 = 14

### Median
Sort values and pick the middle vaue  
Median of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 = 14  
Median of 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 = (14+16)/2 = 15

### Mode
Most commonly occuring value  
Mode of 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9 = 6
Mode of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 = No mode  
Mode of 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5 = 2 and 4

## Measures of Dispersion

### Range
Difference between largest and smallest value of your dataset  
Range of 5, 10, 15 = 10

### Standard Deviation
Measures how spread out the values are from the mean of your dataset.  
Small std deviation means the values are closer together. The range may be less.  
Large standard deviation means the values are more spread out. The range of the dataset is more.

n = number of values  
x = each value  
y = mean of data

$S = \sqrt{\sum_ (x - y)^2 / n-1}$

Standard deviation of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16  
n = 5  
y = 12

$S = \sqrt{((8-12)^2 + (10-12)^2 + (12-12)^2  + (14-12)^2 + (16-12)^2 )/ 5 - 1}$

$S = \sqrt{(16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16) / 4} = \sqrt(40/4) = 3.1622$



### Variance
Average of squared difference of each datapoint from the mean.  
Which is basically the square of standard deviation.

## Measures of Position

### Quartile
Data sorted and divided into 4 tiles.  
11, 12, 14, 18, 22, 23, 27, 33  
Q1 = 13  
Q2 = 20 (Also the median)  
Q3 = 25

IQR (Inter Quartile Range) = Q3 - Q1 = 12

5 number summary = Minimum, 1st quartie, 2nd quartie, 3rd quartile, maximim  
5 number summary for above dataset = 11, 13, 20, 25, 33

### Percentile
Data sorted and divided into 100 tiles.  
75th Percentile means data is higher than 75% of sample data.
