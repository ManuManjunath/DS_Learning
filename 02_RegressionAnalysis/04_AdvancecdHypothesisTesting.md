### $\chi^2$ Goodness of fit test
Determines whether an observed catagprocal variable follows an expected distribution.

* Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)  
The variable follows the expected distribution
* Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)  
The variable does not follow the expected distribution.

$\chi^2 = \sum((Observed - Expected)^2 / Expected)$


### $\chi^2$ test for Independence (Test for homogenity)
Determines whether or not two categorical variabes are associated with each other.  

* Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)  
The variables are independent, and not associated with each other.
* Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)  
The variables are not independent, and are associated with each other.

#### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
A group of statistical techniques that test the difference of means between three or more groups.

* One Way ANOVA Test  
Compares the means of one comtinuous dependent variable based on three or more groups of one categorical value.
* Two Way ANOVA Test  
Compares the means of one continuous dependent variable based on three or more groups of two categorical variables.

#### Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA)
A statistical technique that tests the difference of means between three or more groups while controlling for the effects of covariates, or variable(s) irrelevant to your test.

#### Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
An extension of ANOVA that compares how two or more continuous outcome variables vary according to categorical independent variables.

#### Multivariate Analysis of Co-variance (MANCOVA)
An extension of ANCOVA and MANOVA that compares how two or more continuous outcome variables vary according to categorical independent variables while controlling for covariates.
