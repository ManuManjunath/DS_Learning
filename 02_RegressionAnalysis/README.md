## Regression Analysis or Regression Models

A group of statistical techniques that use existing data to estimate the relationships between a single dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
For example:  
What variables affect sales?  
What factors lead customers to enroll to a service?

#### Linear Regression
A technique that estimates the linear relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
Estimates the mean.  
For example: Relationship between Price of a Product and number of sales.

#### Logistic Regression
A technique that models a categorical dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.  
Estimates the probability.  
For example: Relationship between minutes spent on a news letter and whether the user subscribes to the news letter or not.

#### Types of variables
* Continuous Variable  
Takes on any real value between a minimum and a maximum.  
Example: Product Sales, Vehicle Speed, etc
* Categorical Variable  
Has a finite number of possible values.  
Example: Types of Products, Education Level, etc

#### Dependent and Independent Variables
* Dependent Variables (X) are variables that a given model estimates, also known as response or outcome variables.
* Independent Variables (Y) are variables that explain trends in the dependent variabe, also known as explanatory or predictor variables.

#### Correlation
When 2 variables X & Y are related in a linear way, they are said to be correlated.  
* Positive Correlation: Relationship between 2 variables tend to increase or decrease together.
* Negative Correlation: An inverse relationship between 2 variables, where when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease, and vice versa.
